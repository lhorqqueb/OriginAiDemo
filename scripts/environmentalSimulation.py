Environmental Simulation

Author: Louis H
Date: 2024-08-04

This module simulates environmental data such as temperature and humidity.
The simulator generates random values for these parameters and prints them to the console.

Modules:
    - random: Provides functions for generating random data.
    - time: Provides time-related functions, used here for delays between simulations.

Classes:
    - EnvironmentalSimulator: A class that simulates temperature and humidity.
