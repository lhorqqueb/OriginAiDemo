Combined Simulation for WiFi, Embedded System, and Environmental Data

Author: Louis H
Date: 2024-08-04

This module simulates the combined effect of environmental and embedded system factors on WiFi performance.
It generates random values for temperature, humidity, and embedded system responses, then evaluates WiFi performance.

Modules:
    - random: Provides functions for generating random data.
    - time: Provides time-related functions, used here for delays between simulations.
    - WiFiSimulator: Imports the WiFiSimulator class to simulate WiFi signals.
    - EmbeddedSystemSimulator: Imports the EmbeddedSystemSimulator class to simulate embedded system interactions.
    - EnvironmentalSimulator: Imports the EnvironmentalSimulator class to simulate temperature and humidity.
